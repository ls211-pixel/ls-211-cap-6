# # Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
In the present generation, most people are working hard and neglecting their health, leading to various health issues such as heart diseases and lung diseases. Heart disease has become one of the leading causes of mortality in both men and women. The application of machine learning techniques in medical examinations can significantly enhance the accuracy of disease prediction. This study explores how machine learning and deep learning techniques can be used to predict heart diseases.

## Problem Definition
The main purpose of this study is to predict if anyone is in critical condition for being diagnosed as a patient, for which it needs a quick detection and management. For that, machine learning and deep learning could be a great solution for this problem. This study helps us to research or to develop a model for cardiovascular diseases like heart disease by the use of algorithms in machine learning. We need to collect or to do research to collect the patient data by identifying different people having more rate of heart disease.By various models like machine learning, the classification of the cardiac disease will be solved.

## Methods
### Data Acquisition and Sources
- The dataset contains **918 records** with **12 attributes** such as Age, Sex, Chest Pain, Resting BP, Cholesterol, and MaxHR.
- The target variable is binary: **1 (Heart Disease Present)**, **0 (No Heart Disease)**.
- Dataset obtained from Kaggle: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sisharaneranjana/machine-learning-to-the-fore-to-save-lives/notebook)

### Mathematical and Statistical Methods
#### 1. Naïve Bayes
- Based on **Bayes Theorem**: 
  \[ P(X \mid Y) = \frac{P(Y)P(Y \mid X)}{P(X)} \]
- Predicts heart disease based on cholesterol, blood pressure, and age.

#### 2. Logistic Regression
- Used for binary classification (Heart Disease: Yes/No).
- Considers age, gender, BMI, and family history.

#### 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Uses distance metrics for classification:
  - Euclidean Distance: \( d(a,b) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_i - b_i)^2} \)
  - Manhattan Distance: \( d(a,b) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - b_i| \)

#### 4. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Modeled using connected layers of neurons:
  - \( z = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i y_i + b \)
  - \( a = f(z) \)

#### 5. Random Forest
- Uses multiple decision trees for classification.
- Follows **bagging principle** for improved accuracy and reduced variance.
